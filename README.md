# Youtube-1-click-not-interested
This script provides links below every Youtube thumbnail to mark the video as not-interested or already-watched. Without the script, it takes five clicks to achieve either of these actions: `Ellipsis -> Not Interested -> Tell Us Why -> Checkbox -> Submit`

## How To Install
* Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or an equivalent browser script program
* Restart your browser
* Go to [youtube-1-click-not-interested/main/script.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kannanmavila/youtube-1-click-not-interested/main/script.js) file and it should bring up a popup for installation
  * If not, import the file manually into Tampermonkey
