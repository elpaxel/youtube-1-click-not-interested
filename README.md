# Youtube-1-click-not-interested
This script provides links below every Youtube thumbnail to mark the video as not-interested or already-watched. Without the script, it takes five clicks to achieve either of these actions: `Ellipsis -> Not Interested -> Tell Us Why -> Checkbox -> Submit`

## How To Install
* Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or an equivalent browser script program
* Restart your browser
* Open the `script.js` file and it should bring up a popup for installation
